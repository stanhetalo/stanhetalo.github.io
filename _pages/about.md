**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD Candidate at 🍁[Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/economics/community/news/2020/05/sfu-economics-maintains-top-three-ranking-.html)🍁 with comprehensive expertise in applied microeconomics and causal inference. My primary fields of interest are Environmental and Labour Economics. My research makes use of large admnistrative datasets to inform policy makers about the effect of natural hazards on various outcomes. I am specifically fascinated with rigorous understading the ways we could better coexist and respond to rapidly changing climate.
