**Welcome to my website!**

I am an Economics PhD Candidate at üçÅ[Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/economics/community/news/2020/05/sfu-economics-maintains-top-three-ranking-.html)üçÅ with expertise in Applied Microeconomics and Causal Inference. My primary fields of interest are Environmental and Labour Economics. My research makes use of large administrative datasets to inform policy makers about the effect of natural hazards on a diverse set of outcomes. I am interested in research projects that will contribute rigorous evidence to help communities better adapt to a rapidly changing climate.
